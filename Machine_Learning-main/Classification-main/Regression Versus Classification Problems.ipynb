    "# Regression Versus Classification Problems\n",
    "Variables can be characterized as either quantitative or qualitative (also\n",
    "quantitative\n",
    "known as categorical). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantitative variables \n",
    "take on numerical values. \n",
    "\n",
    "## qualitative\n",
    "Examples include a person’s age, height, or income, the value of a house, categorical\n",
    "and the price of a stock. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, qualitative variables take on values in one of K different classes, or categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression and Classification algorithms are Supervised Learning algorithms. Both the algorithms are used for prediction in Machine learning and work with the labeled datasets. But the difference between both is how they are used for different machine learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The main difference between Regression and Classification algorithms that \n",
    "\n",
    "Regression algorithms are used to predict the continuous values such as price, salary, age, etc. and \n",
    "\n",
    "Classification algorithms are used to predict/Classify the discrete values such as Male or Female, True or False, Spam or Not Spam, etc.\n",

    "## Consider the below diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./i/claas_reg.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is a process of finding a function which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a computer program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: \n",
    "The best example to understand the Classification problem is Email Spam Detection. The model is trained on the basis of millions of emails on different parameters, and whenever it receives a new email, it identifies whether the email is spam or not. If the email is spam, then it is moved to the Spam folder.\n",

    "## Regression:\n",
    "Regression is a process of finding the correlations between dependent and independent variables. It helps in predicting the continuous variables such as prediction of Market Trends, prediction of House prices, etc.\n",

    "The task of the Regression algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input variable(x) to the continuous output variable(y).\n",

    "### Example: \n",
    "Suppose we want to do weather forecasting, so for this, we will use the Regression algorithm. In weather prediction, the model is trained on the past data, and once the training is completed, it can easily predict the weather for future days.\n",
