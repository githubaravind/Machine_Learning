    "# Difference between Parametric and Non-Parametric Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parametric Methods\n",
    "The basic idea behind the parametric method is that there is a set of fixed parameters that uses to determine a probability model that is used in Machine Learning as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parametric methods are those methods for which we priory knows that the population is normal, or if not then we can easily approximate it using a normal distribution which is possible by invoking the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "Parameters for using the normal distribution is –\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mean\n",
    "* Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, the classification of a method to be parametric is completely depends on the presumptions that are made about a population. There are many parametric methods available some of them are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Confidence interval used for – population mean along with known standard deviation.\n",
    "* The confidence interval is used for – population means along with the unknown standard deviation.\n",
    "* The confidence interval for population variance.\n",
    "* The confidence interval for the difference of two means, with unknown standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parametric methods involve a two-step model-based approach.\n",
    "from book:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First,\n",
    "we make an assumption about the functional form, or shape,\n",
    "of f. For example, one very simple assumption is that f is linear in\n",
    "X:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(X) = β0 + β1*(X1) + β2*(X2) + . . . + βp*(Xp).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of having to estimate an entirely\n",
    "arbitrary p-dimensional function f(X), one only needs to estimate\n",
    "the p + 1 coefficients β0, β1, . . . , βp.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### second:\n",
    "After a model has been selected, we need a procedure that uses the\n",
    "training data to fit or train the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "we need to estimate the parameters β0, β1, . . . , βp. That is, we\n",
    "want to find values of these parameters such that\n",
    "\n",
    "Y ≈ β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + . . . + βpXp.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common approach to fitting the model  is referred to\n",
    "as **`(ordinary) least squares`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "it reduces the problem of estimating f down to one of estimating a set of parameters means Parametric.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### disadvantage\n",
    "The potential disadvantage of a parametric approach is that the model we choose will usually not match the true\n",
    "unknown form of f. If the chosen model is too far from the true f, then our estimate will be poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can try to address this problem by choosing flexible models that can fit many different possible functional forms for f. **But in general**, fitting a more flexible model requires estimating a greater number of parameters. These more complex models can lead to a phenomenon known as overfitting the data, which essentially means they\n",
    "overfitting follow the errors, or noise, too closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nonparametric Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In Non-Parametric methods, there is no need to make any assumption of parameters for the given population or the population we are studying. In fact, the methods don’t depend on the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here there is no fixed set of parameters are available, and also there is no distribution (normal distribution, etc.) of any kind is available for use. This is also the reason that nonparametric methods are also referred to as distribution-free methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays Non-parametric methods are gaining popularity and an impact of influence some reasons behind this fame is –\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason is that there is no need to be mannered while using parametric methods.\n",
    "The second important reason is that we do not need to make more and more assumptions about the population given (or taken) on which we are working on.\n",
    "Most of the nonparametric methods available are very easy to apply and to understand also i.e. the complexity is very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many nonparametric methods are available today but some of them are –\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spearman correlation test\n",
    "* Sign test for population means\n",
    "* U-test for two independent means\n",
